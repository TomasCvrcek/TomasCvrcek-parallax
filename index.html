        <h2>NIGHTMARIONNE</h2>
        <p>As you may notice, this your office. You're gonne stay here for the night (of forever, if you're unlucky enough). 
            We assume, that you have the needed power-ups. If so, let's begin! 
            The very first thing you have to do is press 1, space and move mouse to the left center part of screen,
            otherwise you might ending up dying in less than a second. 
            The reason for that is Nightmarionne.
            This character stays in the office all the night. 
            He starts to appear when you hover over him and takes approximately 0.8s to jumpscare. 
            He changes his position throughout the night, so you have move your mouse all the time. 
            Left and right centers of screen are safe spots.

        <h2>DUCTS AND MONITOR TURN OFF</h2>
        <p>First REAL step. You have to turn on camera and change to DUCT SYSTEM immidietly to prevent Phantom BB and Phantom mangle jumpscare. 
            In the DUCT SYSTEM click on the left center of the monitor and open right duct. 
            This mechanic is called "audio lure". Than you can turn the monitor down. 
        </p>
        <h3>Every time you turn the monitor off, there are a few steps to make:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take mask on and off to prevent Golden Freddy jumpscare</li>
            <li>Move mouse to left center</li>
            <li>If Phantom freddy is almost fully visible use flashligt on him</li>
            <li>If Freddles are appearing use flashligt on him</li>
            <li>If Nightmare BB is standing use flashlight on him</li>
            <li>If you see BB or JJ in right vent press F and wait 0.5s</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>VENT SNARE</h2>
        <p class="optional"><i>This step is optional</i></p>
        <p>You're two seconds into the game. 
            Turn on the monitor and chnge to VENT SYSTEM. 
            By clicking on the left light-blue square you can apply "vent snare" on the shortest path. 
            This is mainly because of Mangle. He cannot return by closing front vent. 
            The only way to prevent her from getting there is vent snare and not asking his gender. 
            If an animatronic encounters vent snare, it returns and you get a fazcoin.

        <h2>FAZCOINS</h2>
        <p>One of the main tasks is to collect Fazcoins. 
            They are important for deathcoin or to get rid of Rockstar Freddy.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Below is a list of possible actions to gain fazcoins:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding them on camera</li>
                <li>By clicking Helpy</li>
                <li>From vent snare</li>
                <li>By closing doors on animatronics</li>
                <li><b>!!! If multiple animatronics are being stopped by doors only one coin is recieved !!!</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A few more notes:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>BB and JJ are best for collecting coins. 
                The best method is switching monitor on and off, than closing right vent and looking for Helpy</li>
                <li>Nigtmare and Nightmare Fredbear will appear if you have monitor open on multiple of 5.0s</li>
            <li>Although Nightmare and Nightmare Fredbear are blocked by different doors, closing both at once will give you only one coin</li>
            <li>Helpy must be clicked in less than 7s after spawn, otherwise hel will greatly increase noise for a second</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>FIVE NIGHTS WITH Mr. HUGS</h2>
        <p>You may be playing FNaF but so does Toy Freddy! 
            However, his fingers are not well-suited for keyboard, so you have to play his game as well. 
            Turn on the monitor and switch to  CAM08. If Mr. Hugs is on Toy Freddy's monitor, press the grren circle below CAM1. 
            If not check CAM2. If he isn't even there, you can close the doors below CAM3. 
            Than check CAM05 and go back to CAM05. This may help with cam-stalling foxy, if his figure is on the office table. 
            Even if Toy Freddy loses his game, there is a chance of him not jumpscaring. 
            Another method to prevent his jumpscare is on being on cams at multiples of 0.5s.

        <h2>13 SECONDS, MASK AND BALLORA</h2>
        <p>On a multiples of 13.0s mark, you have to have closed monitor. 
            There is a chance for Withered or Rockstar Bonnie to appear. 
            Withered Bonnie jumpscare can be avoided by having mask on for a longer period of time but Rockstar Bonnie meas death.
            For not getting noticed by Toy Bonnie and Toy chica, Put your mask on, when they enter the office. 
            Ballora willa atack at 20.0s marks. Close the acording doors, when you hear her.

        <h2>POWER GENERATOR AND STUFF</h2>
        <p>These are mechanics, that gets rid of most of the animatronics. 
            That also brings the challenge of making you dance on your keyboard and possibly breaking your fingers. 
            These mechanics are used all the night and will tast your memory and knowledge about time. 
            If you remember what to do and <i>when</i> to do it, you're good to go.
            ALso, only one of the mechanics can be on at a time (except fan, that's a different mechanic)
        </p>
        <h3>Below is a list of each of the mechanics:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Power Generator: start at beginning, change to music box at 14.5, than always 14s for power generator, 16s for music box</li>
            <li>Silent Ventilation: N/A</li>
            <li>Heater: use if you're afraid of the duct animatronics or want to short-circuit Rockstar Freddy</li>
            <li>Power A/C: use to get rid of Nightmare Chica, or if the office is too hot</li>
            <li>Global Music Box: start at 14.5, turn off at 30.5, repeat 14/16 second cycle. Chica will check, if it is on every 15.0s</li>
            <li>Fan: use to keep the temperature below 89.5Â°</li>

        <h2>NUKE VENEZUELA</h2>
        <p class="optional"><i>This step is optional</i></p>
        <p>You may have noticed, that you're low on power. Much lower, than it should be. 
            That's because secret agents in Venezuela are stealing it. 
            To prevent heavy power loss, you might consider nuking Venezuela as a solution for you to survive the night. 
            So, choose at which part of Caracas you want to your nuke to explode. 
            You can either drop a classic nuke, or selecting Tsar bomba by <b>right-clicking</b>. 
            This action will cost extra fazcoins. Release the nuke by pressing <b>left mouse button</b>.

        <h2>XOR</h2>
        <p>Maybe you don't know it, but you're not actualy playing 50/20, you're playing 56/20. 
            That's because of and animatronic called XOR (or Shadow Dee Dee). 
            She has a chance to show up at 10.0s mark or every 7.0s after that and brimg six new animatronics. 
            The earlier she appears, the better.
        </p>
        <h3>Below is a list of each of the animatronics and how to deal with them:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Plushtrap: Watch him for a while, while deathcoining Funtime Foxy on CAM06</li>
            <li>Nightmare Chica: turn on Power A/C</li>
            <li>Lolbit: type LOL on your keyboard</li>
            <li>Minareenas: No way to stop, your sight will be blocked</li>
            <li>Bonnet: When he runs, click his nose</li>
            <li>RWQFSFASXC (Shadow Bonnie):  No way to stop, the office will get dark</li>

        <h2>DEATH COIN</h2>
        <p>If you have have more than 10 fazcoins, you can go to CAM07, buy death coin, then go to CAM06 and click on on death coin symbol in the top right corner. 
            With this action Funtime Foxy is no longer in the game. This must be done before 45.0s mark.  
            To avoid his jumpscare without death coin, it is necessary to be on his cam at exact time, which make cam-stalling impossible. 
            By stying on his cam for 1.6s - 1.8s you can also get rid of Plushtrap. 
            From now on always click on RESET VENTILATION, when you're turning off the monitor.

        <h2>CAM STALLING AND MONITOR FLIP NECESSITIES</h2>
        <p>Cam stalling is a machanics, that prevents animatronics from moving if you look at them at cameras. 
            From now on let your camera at CAM02 and pray for Toy Freddy RNG. 
            For plushie animatronics, there is a space, where they cannot attack and you can chage the camera freely. 
            These windows are 45.0s - 1:05.0s, 2:15.0s - 2:35.0s and 3:45 - 4:05.0. 
            This method also works in the office for mid-vent animatronics. 
            Springtrap, Withered Chica, Ennard and Mangle can enter only if you've opened the monitor.
            To avoid this and Freddy, close left doors and mid-vent every time you go check the cameras.
        </p>
        <h3>Cam-stall will prevent:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Circus Baby</li>
            <li>Nightmare Mangle</li>
            <li>Nightmare Bonnie</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Jack-O-Chica, Lefty: Keep temperature below 89.5Â°, if it's higher, close both doors</li>
            <li>Freddy: First time he'll get to the left door is 33.0s - 37.0s</li>
            <li>Afton (Scraptrap): Press F, whe the light is flickering</li>
            <li>Scrap Baby: If she is looking at you press the control shock button</li>
            <li>Rockstar Chica: Double-click the wet floor sign at 35.0s, after you cam stall CAM02, double-click again</li>
            <li>Music Man: Keep the volume down</li>
            <li>Phone Guy: Click "mute call"</li>

        <h2>REST OF THE NIGHT</h2>

        <p>Probably the hardest part of the night is avoiding Foxy jumpscare. 
            For that Foxy figure must be on the table as short as possible. 
            Take a good look at the table every time you close the monitor. 
            If Bonnie figure is on the table, do not turn on the cams until you have to restart ventilation. 
            If Foxy figure is on the table, wait for about 7-8 seconds, than press W, S, reset ventilation, S, W as fast as you can. 
            To avoid Lefty, don't have tha cams on on .0s marks, to avoid ducts animatronics short usage of monitor helps (if you're worried, you can use the heater). 
            Now all you have to worry about is temperature, power, music box, Ballora, Toy Bonnie and Chica, flashligt, ventilation reset, 
            distractions, noise, timestaps and foxy. 
            If you managed to survive, than congratulation! You can enjoy final screen, score 50600 and life in jeil for war crimes in Venezuela.
